XAMS Change Password plugin for SquirrelMail
---------------------------------------------

Version 0.0.3

If the system administrator provides users with access to the XAMS GUI,
it is possible for users to change their passwords. XAMS options can also
be used to restrict access.

If you do not want your users to use the XAMS GUI to change their passwords,
this plugin can be used in conjunction with SquirrelMail to provide users
with a way to change their passwords. (This assumes you use
SquirrelMail as your tool for providing webmail to your users.)

The installation process is quite simple. Assuming your SquirrelMail is
installed at @WEBMAIL_DIR@/squirrelmail then perform the following tasks:

# cd /usr/src/xams-@VERSION@/contrib/squirrelmail/
# cp -R xams_chpasswd @WEBMAIL_DIR@/squirrelmail/plugins/.
- If xams_global not already installed
# cp -R xams_global @WEBMAIL_DIR@/squirrelmail/plugins/.
# cp xams-webmail.conf /etc/squirrelmail/. 
# chown root.www-data /etc/squirrelmail/xams-webmail.conf
# chmod 640 /etc/squirrelmail/xams-webmail.conf 
- Install xams_chpasswd plugin in squirrelmail
# run squirrelmail-configure 
- Hit [8] for Plugins
- Select xams_chpasswd from the 'Available Plugins' list
- Save [S] and Quit [Q]

Installation of any XAMS plugins for SquirrelMail (including this one) requires
that you also copy the /usr/src/xams-@VERSION@/contrib/squirrelmail/xams_global
directory to your SquirrelMail plugins directory!

That's it. After logging into SquirrelMail you should see an additional item in
your Options menu.

If you want to translate this plugin into your language, take a look at the
locale sub-directory and also read the relevant SquirrelMail docs on this topic
